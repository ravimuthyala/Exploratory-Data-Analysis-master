## Exploratory Data Analysis - Course Project

This repository houses the results for the 1st course project for the Exploratory Data Analysis class in the Data Science Specialization.  The following quoted section comes from the forked original [readme.md](https://github.com/mjfii/Exploratory-Data-Analysis/blob/master/assignment_readme.md) file.  The result and solutions are found below following the quoted section.

> Our overall goal here is simply to examine how household energy usage varies over a 2-day period in February, 2007. Your task is to reconstruct the following plots below, all of which were constructed using the base plotting system.

> First you will need to fork and clone the following GitHub repository: [https://github.com/rdpeng/ExData_Plotting1](https://github.com/rdpeng/ExData_Plotting1)

> For each plot you should:

> * Construct the plot and save it to a PNG file with a width of 480 pixels and a height of 480 pixels.

> * Name each of the plot files as `plot1.png`, `plot2.png`, etc.

> * Create a separate R code file (`plot1.R`, `plot2.R`, etc.) that constructs the corresponding plot, i.e. code in `plot1.R` constructs the `plot1.png` plot. 

> * Your code file **should include code for reading the data** so that the plot can be fully reproduced. You should also include the code that creates the PNG file.

> * Add the PNG file and R code file to your git repository

> When you are finished with the assignment, push your git repository to GitHub so that the GitHub version of your repository is up to date. There should be four PNG files and four R code files.

**Solutions for the above:**

1. Plots can be found in the [plots](https://github.com/mjfii/Exploratory-Data-Analysis/tree/master/plots) directory of this repository.  All plots are PNG files per specification.

2. The R code to create each of the plots can be found in the [scripts](https://github.com/mjfii/Exploratory-Data-Analysis/tree/master/scripts) directory of this repository.

3. In addition to code generating each plot, there is a script to generate the usable data set in the [scripts](https://github.com/mjfii/Exploratory-Data-Analysis/tree/master/scripts) directory call [get_and_clean_data.R](https://github.com/mjfii/Exploratory-Data-Analysis/blob/master/scripts/get_and_clean_data.R).  This script downloads, unzips, reads, cleanses, and filters the data so the plots can be reproduced at anytime.
